# My-AHK-keyboard
My custom distribution for my keyboard


I worked many months creating this keyboard specific for me and my needs

All the keys that i need (Arrows, Home, End, Delete, Enter) added in a new layer that i can switch on with the CapsLock key.
I deleted the real function of the Capslock key to create this keyboard.
This way, i got all these keys into the QWERTY section 

I inspired in two links of AHK foro to create all the functions of this code.
