# My-AHK-keyboard
My custom distribution for my keyboard

I worked many months creating this keyboard specific for me and my needs

The goal was to put all the useful keys such us Arrows, Home, End, Enter, Delete, with their combinations with Alt, Ctrl and Windows keys, into the QWERTY section.

Spend many hours inside on foros searching answers for every problem and trying undertand the lenguage because I diddn't know it.
After finding the definitive answers to resolve this challenge in the AHK forums, I compile all the code section that i find in this script.

Here are the links to the forums that inspire me.
